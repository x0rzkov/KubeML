# KubeML

## Introduction

KubeML is a PaaS that directly competes with AWS SageMaker for building, training, and testing machine-learning models. KubeML provisions cloud infrastructure based on client needs and launches a Jupyter Enterprise deployment. Client's access JupyterHub for launching multiple kernels. KubeML deploys the identical, open-source Jupyter IDE environment as AWS SageMaker without the price mark-up.
